This github is a python wrapper of the Symbolic Regression method based equality graph, eggp, proposed by the paper ["Improving Genetic Programming for Symbolic Regression with Equality Graphs"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17848). This implementation includes a multi-view approach of the data, as explained in the paper ["Multi-View Symbolic Regression"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04298). The goal of MvSR is to discover parametric equations able to describe an ensemble of datasets, rather than generating a single solution to a single dataset. This wrapper is focused around the MvSR aspect of eggp. Very few steps are required to use the method.


First download the executable:

Then rename the file eggp
